      "Cancelem vosso show em Israel   Cancel your concert in Israel\n",
      "(English below) Queridos Caetano e Gil, \n",
      " Com admiração ao trabalho de vocês e seu histórico de comprometimento com lutas pela liberdade, justiça e igualdade, pedimos que cancelem vosso show em Israel, previsto para 28 de julho. A data coincide com o aniversário de um ano dos ataques de Israel a Gaza, nos quais mais de 2 mil palestinas e palestinos foram mortos, incluindo mais 500 crianças. Ainda hoje, mais de 100 mil pessoas seguem desabrigadas em decorrência da ofensiva. \n",
      " Tocar em Israel é endossar políticas e práticas racistas, coloniais e de apartheid -ilegais sob o direito internacional. Ademais, o governo israelense apresenta os shows em Israel como um sinal de aprovação a suas políticas. Israel viola sistematicamente o direito internacional ao impedir o retorno dos refugiados palestinos, ao colonizar e ocupar a Cisjordânia e a Faixa de Gaza e ao discriminar sistematicamente os palestinos cidadãos de Israel. As políticas discriminatórias de Israel também se manifestam contra refugiados e migrantes africanos: recentemente milhares de etíopes foram brutalmente reprimidos ao protestarem contra o racismo no país. \n",
      " Nosso pedido faz coro ao chamado de artistas e da sociedade civil palestina para que artistas não se apresentem em Israel. Entre aqueles que responderam a esse chamado, cancelando seus shows no país, estão Lauryn Hill, Roger Waters (Pink Floyd), Snoop Dog, Carlos Santana, Cold Play, Lenny Kravitz e Elvis Costello. \n",
      " O arcebisbo sul-africano Desmond Tutu, Nobel da Paz, é um importante apoiador desse chamado e explica que apresentar-se em Tel Aviv é errado “assim como dissémos que era inapropriado para artistas internacionais tocarem na África do Sul durante o apartheid, em uma sociedade fundada em leis discriminatórias e exclusividade racial”. Se apresentar em Israel seria como fazer um show em Sun City na Africa do Sul do apartheid. \n",
      " Não ignorem esse chamado. Tropicália não combina com apartheid! \n",
      "  -- \n",
      " Dear Caetano and Gill, \n",
      " With admiration to your work and historical commitment with struggles for justice, freedom and equality, we ask you to cancel your concert in Tel Aviv, scheduled for July 28. July will mark the one year anniversary of the Israeli attacks against Gaza during which Israel killed more than 2,000 Palestinians, including over 500 children. More than 100,000 remain homeless due to these attacks. \n",
      " Performing in Israel serves as a stamp of approval for Israel’s illegal racist, colonial and apartheid policies. The Israeli government portrays concerts in Israel as a sign of support for its policies. Israel systematically violates international law: it prevents Palestinian refugees from returning to their homes, it colonises and occupies the West Bank and Gaza, and it systematically discriminates against Palestinian citizens of Israel. And it’s not just Palestinians that face Israeli oppression: thousands of Ethiopian migrants were recently brutally repressed for protesting against racism in Israel. \n",
      " Our request echoes Palestinian artists and civil society, who are calling for artists not to perform in Israel. Artists that have answered this call include Lauryn Hill, Roger Waters (Pink Floyd), Snoop Dog, Carlos Santana, Cold Play, Lenny Kravitz and Elvis Costello. \n",
      " The South African Nobel Prize winner, archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is an important supporter of the Palestinian call for boycott, has explained that performing in Tel Aviv is wrong, “just as we said during apartheid that it was inappropriate for international artists to perform in South Africa in a society founded on discriminatory laws and racial exclusivity”. Performing in Israel today is the equivalent of performing in Sun City South Africa during the apartheid era. \n",
      " Do not ignore this call. Supporting apartheid isn’t the Tropicalia way!\n",

Why? to apply pressure on Israel to comply with basic principles of justice and international law in regards to its illegal settlements, its daily violations of human rights and denial of Palestines right to self determination.  UK Supermarkets when you trade with Israel you are not only funding Israels economy but also rewarding apartheid policies, encouraging Illegal settlement activities & prolonging the occupation of Palestine. There are many alternative suppliers in europe so why trade with a state complicit in grave human rights violations?  UK Supermarkets stop funding apartheid, occupation & the daily violation of human rights in Palestine, as a corporation you have a duty of responsibility to do what is right, to stand by human rights and trade ethically, why risk damaging your reputation ? Be ethical be moral stand on the right side of history Apartheid was not acceptable in South Africa what makes it right in Palestine?    Boycott Israel.\n",

      "Organise debate on Israel-Palestine coverage\n",
      "We are concerned at the very partial nature of BBC reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  While some reporters have shown great bravery in war zones, much home-based journalism lacks context and is unable to report the Palestinian perspective. The attacks on Gaza are presented by Israel and the BBC as being directed at militants, while for Palestinians they are an extension of military rule and collective punishment by a brutal apartheid state. \n",
      " This inability to report the reality of the Israeli occupation has been repeatedly shown by academic studies and reports, including that led by  Quentin Thomas , commissioned by the BBC, which noted the \"failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, reflecting the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation\", and said: \"In short, we found that BBC output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict.\" (Thomas, 2006: 4-7) The BBC has failed to act on any of these findings. \n",
      " The search for peace is not well served by giving the public such a partial and limited view.  We ask now that the BBC produce a televised, public debate to discuss how to redress the deficiencies in its coverage to offer a better account of the sources of this conflict and therefore how it might be resolved. \n",

      "We ask Beyoncé to stand on the side of justice and cancel her concert in Tel Aviv, Israel. She is scheduled to play to a segregated audience in Israel on June 15, 2014, the venue has not been confirmed. This boycott is \"inspired by the struggle of South Africans against apartheid and in the spirit of international solidarity, moral consistency and resistance to injustice and oppression.\" Israel is a persistent violator of international law and has failed to respect fundamental human rights. She has recently used the words of feminist best-selling author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in her song \"***Flawless\", most notably the following excerpt: \"Feminist: a person who believes in the social political, and economic equality of the sexes.\" If Beyoncé believes in the social and political equality of the sexes, she cannot perform in a country where Palestinian women and men alike are not given the opportunity to access social, poltiical and economic equality under occupation. Until  Israel ends its occupation and oppression of the people of Palestine we ask you, as a person of conscience and a philanthropist, not to play in Israel.

      "Every year Israel imports tens of thousands of unwanted dairy calves from Hungary, Romania, and Lithuania. After enduring the horrific ordeal of being separated from their mothers, these calves are sent on seemingly never ending journeys to reach Israel.  Many die a long and slow death en route.  They pass from one country to another in Europe before being loaded onto ships destined for Israel.  Every step of their journey involves beatings, freezing or hot weather, hunger and cruel handling.  \n",
      " Although the European Union has evidence that calves from its member states are being cruelly treated, and endure journeys that break the law, it does nothing.  The lucky ones are the ones that die en route. Once in Israel many calves cross the border into Gaza.  Calves are fattened up in appalling conditions before being sent off to slaugherhouses that are hell on earth.

      "Of the 26,000 sexual assaults in 2012, only 3,374 were reported and only 302 were brought to trial. I am a retired U.S. Navy Veteran and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivor. And like many other victims in the military, I was harassed, and humiliated by my Chain of Command after reporting my abuse. But a bipartisan bill before the U.S. Senate right now can completely change how sexual assaults in the military are handled - the Military Justice Improvement Act.  \n",
      " As it stands now, any U.S. Military personnel, male or female, who are sexually assaulted or harassed are at the mercy of their own Commanding Officers who have full jurisdiction and discretion in prosecuting these cases.  In many of the cases the perpetrator is not prosecuted while the victim is treated as the criminal, ostracized and harassed by their own command and often their military service stands in jeopardy. This is why so many assaults go unreported. \n",
      " Even though I was raped while in the Navy, my case it is a story of command harassment.  During a 5 year period I was harassed, by my command because the Maintenance Officer didn't want \"women in his Navy\".  Between being raped and continuously harassed I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2001.  I was raped and it was traumatizing, but the most devastating thing was the Command Harassment. \n",
      " The Military Justice Improvement Act (S. 967) changes this by taking the Commanding Officer out of the case and providing a specialized legal group in charge of investigating and prosecuting these cases. This is a common sense step that our closest allies, including the UK, Canada, Australia and Israel, have made to their militaries.  \n",
      " The Military Justice Improvement Act has bipartisan support but needs more votes to pass and it will be voted on this week. Your Senator needs to hear from you about this important bill now!  \n",
      " I spent 20 years trying to run away from the hell the Navy put me though. I was told that all of my problems were between my ears. They tried to Court Marshal me, they harassed me on a daily basis, and when I was transferred the harassment continued because my perpetrator picked up the phone and had me labeled a troublemaker before I even checked in.  If the Military Justice Improvement Act had been passed then, that wouldn't have happened to me.  \n",
      " Help us get the word to Congress that the rape culture in the military is still prevalent.  Tell them we will no longer allow our men and women in the military to be raped, tell them that we WILL hold them accountable.  \n",

      " The region’s people are having a hard time finding food, let alone the animals. The zoo is not bringing in revenue anymore, as almost no one visits since the fighting began. Staff have taken to stuffing the animals that die and putting them back on display, to maintain the facade of a lively zoo. \n",
      " These animals are innocent, and should not be victims of the war. An agency called Four Paws is currently working to try and secure the release of these animals.  Please join me and ask the South Jungle Zoo to consider working with Four Paws to secure the release of the surviving animals to qualified aid organizations, sanctuaries or zoos in more stable regions. \n",
      " Many of these animals are already endangered, and to drag them through such suffering is senseless. Of the six ostriches, only one is still alive. The lions and the only llama died in December. There are no more crocodiles. One tiger remains, and the owner was recently quoted saying it had not eaten in four or five days. \n",
      " Half of the remaining 20 or so animals and birds in the zoo are ill due to lack of veterinary care. We must act now to save them. \n",
      " Let’s implore the South Jungle Zoo’s owner to release all of his surviving animals to qualified organizations and sanctuaries that can nurse them back to health. It is their only hope.\n",

      "The idea that white South Africans have the right to return to Europe is based in the concept of indigenous rights and self determination. \n",
      " The white South African population currently faces ethnic cleansing and persecutions at the hands of the ANC government, the EFF, and various individual anti-white aggressors. Over 4000 white farmers have been brutally murdered, often including torture and rape and mutilation. Many white South Africans today live in poverty and squalor as a consequence of the ANC government's Black Economic Empowerment policy which shuts whites out of the labour pool. \n",
      " Based on the Israeli government's policy of allowing all Jews the right to return to Israel, we believe it is not only advisable but morally obligatory that Europe should allow all white South Africans the right to return. \n",
      " As it currently stands, many white South Africans who try to apply for citizenship to European countries such as the Netherlands and UK are rejected. Many of these white South Africans seeking citizenship are direct descendants of the very same European nations that reject them. \n",
      " Obviously certain details of this policy are subject to deliberation. For instance, whether the white South Africans would have the right to return to any European nation of their choosing, or if they would specifically have the right to return to whatever nation the majority of their ancestry is from (which in most cases would be the Netherlands or UK). \n",
      " Also this would extend to whites in Zimbabwe and Namibia, given that they face a similar situation. But white South Africans are the largest population group of whites in southern Africa by far, so that is why the name of this petition references them specifically.\n",

      "Immigration is not the issue, Canada is a country built by immigrants, and a majority of those who come to Canada from abroad like Sikh, Hindu, Buddhists, Christians, Jews, Kurds, Asians, Europeans etc. are good, honest people.

Arye Mekel of Israel’s Foreign Ministry explained “We willsend well-known novelists and writers overseas, theatre companies, exhibits… This way you show Israel’s prettier face, so we are not thought of purely in the context of war.” Shall EBU contribute to the hiding of the ugly truth, by pretending it doesn't exist?

      "  On the other hand,  YOU have done nothing  to prepare the State for water shortages and increased population. Blaming the weather is flatout irresponsible. You had plenty of warning. Our water system is old and not capable of sustaining growth or lack of rain. \n",

      " Water desalinization – Better, efficient, solar-powered technology is available now. The biggest ocean in the world is right next to us. \n",

      "  We spent years planting trees, grass and plants, making our cars more efficient and reducing pollution to clean our air quality. We can’t go back to pollution. \n",
      "  Air quality and greenhouse gases will create a man-made climate change. By reducing the irrigation of our gardens, we will be killing our grass, plants and trees. This will reduce the amount of oxygen producing organisms and increase our CO2 levels affecting our greenhouse gases, damaging our air quality and increasing the number of people suffering from respiratory and pulmonary diseases. \n",
      " Reduced production of healthy California produce:  You are asking farmers to decrease their water usage. This will also reduce the amount of produce grown in California and kill our farming industry. The unacceptable alternative would be to import produce from China and other non-FDA regulated countries that use dangerous pesticides and fertilizers. You will seriously harm our health! \n",

      "(Scroll Down for our 6 National Hands Up Demands) \n",
      " A long and completely avoidable history of violence by police officers has killed too many innocent civilians, caused a destructive level of mistrust in the community, and is causing a rising tide of anger, frustration, and despair among millions of good people. \n",
      " This petition is for Amadou Diallo  - shot at 41 times. An innocent, hardworking man simply reaching for his wallet, Diallo should be alive today. \n",
      " This petition is for Sean Bell  - shot at over 50 times and killed on his wedding day.  \n",
      " This petition is for Oscar Grant  - handcuffed with his hands behind his back for breaking a fight on the subway - Oscar was shot in the back and killed by a police officer while sitting down. \n",
      " This petition is for Chavis Carter  - arrested for marijuana, searched, handcuffed with his hands behind his back, and put into the back of a police car. Chavis is then said to have somehow killed himself with a gun.  \n",
      " This petition is for Wendell Allen  - just 20 years old - police busted into a house and shot him in the heart - killing him. He wasn't who they were looking for. \n",
      " This petition is for Rekia Boyd  - an unarmed Black woman shot and killed because an officer thought her cell phone was a gun. \n",
      " This petition is for Luis Rodriguez  - an unarmed father who was beaten and choked to death in front of his family for not showing his ID outside a movie theater. \n",
      " This petition is for Eric Garner  - choked to death on YouTube for the entire world to see. While the coroner has deemed his death a homicide, we must change the laws to prevent this from ever happening again. \n",
      " This petition is for Israel Hernandez  - a young artist that was murdered by Miami Beach Police Department after he was caught tagging an abandoned building. \n",
      " This petition is for Mike Brown  - unarmed and shot to death in Ferguson, Missouri, we are still waiting for even the basic answers here. \n",
      " We encourage you to Google these names and cases for yourself. \n",
      " This petition is for these men, and for many other unarmed men and women who have been killed by the police.  It is unacceptable for the police to serve as JUDGE, JURY, and EXECUTIONER.  The recent murders of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and John Crawford this past month at the hands of police have so inflamed communities across the country that we believe we are reaching a tipping point of anger. \n",
      " It is our hope to channel this collective anger into effective policy solutions that will not only make life safer for citizens, but will restore confidence in police, and bring hope to hopeless families and communities devastated by these egregious acts of violence. \n",
      " Our 6 National Hands Up Demands are: \n",
      " 1. Obama needs to “Do the Right Thing” and go to Ferguson and meet with local black and brown youth. 2. Eric Holder meet with local black and brown youth across the country who are dealing with “Zero Tolerance” and “Broken Windows” policing.   3. Ensure transparency, accountability, and safety of our communities, by requiring front-facing cameras on police departments with records of racial disparity in stops, arrest, killings, and excessive force complaints. 4. Cops need consequences too. Police officers who discharge their weapon on an unarmed person should be suspended without pay pending further investigation. And their name and policing histories should be made available to the public. 5. Tanks and tear gas don’t ever belong in our communities. America should not be going to war with it’s citizens. Demilitarize all police departments. 6. Police should be representative of the communities they are tasked to protect and serve and community members should have  real  power  in citizen review boards. \n",
      "   \n",
      " Our 7 Policy Solutions Are As Follows: \n",
      " 1. The avoidable shooting and killing or otherwise murdering of an unarmed citizen who does not have an outstanding warrant for a violent crime should be a federal offense. \n",
      " 2. Choke holds and chest compressions by police (what the coroner lists as the official cause of death for Eric Garner) should be federally banned. \n",
      " 3. All police officers must wear forward-facing body cameras while on duty. They cost just $99 and are having a significant, positive impact in several cities around the United States and the world. Turning them off should warrant immediate termination.   \n",
      " 4. A trusted 3rd party business should monitor and store all videos from forward facing cameras. \n",
      " 5. Suspensions for violations of any of the above offenses should be UNPAID. If a third party review board clears the officer, the back pay, which could sit in escrow could be given back to the officer. If found guilty, the money in escrow should be given to victims of police violence. \n",
      " 6. All murders by police must be investigated, immediately so, by a trusted and unbiased third party. It is not sufficient for the police, who are like a family, to investigate a murder by one of their own. \n",
      " 7. Convictions for the above offenses should have their own set of mandatory minimum penalties. The men who killed Diallo, Bell, Grant, Carter, Garner, and others all walk free while over 1,000,000 non violent offenders are currently incarcerated in American prisons. \n",
      " These federal actions are in the best interest of our country. We will direct our anger, our dollars, our votes, and our voice to seeing them happen all across the country. \n",

      "Please ban torturous shock devices used on special needs people\n",
      "I deeply regret having worked as a teacher’s assistant at The Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC), a “special needs school” in Canton, Massachusetts, where children and teenagers with autism and other disabilities are administered electric shocks as a means of controlling their behaviors.   \n",
      " I joined the JRC because I thought I would be helping these special needs students.  But it became clear that this practice was painful, traumatic, and more harmful than good. I never would have used these \"GED\" shock devices had JRC not told me and other staff in training that the GEDs had been “approved by the FDA”.  When asking an administrator about the severe thick and bloodied scabby injuries all over students' bodies, I was told that these machines had been tested and were “proven to be safe” as necessary to get FDA approval.  I did not know until 2012 that this was a lie! \n",
      " The human rights abuses taking place at the JRC are well documented.  In 2013, the United Nations in “Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. Méndez,” unequivocally stated that the methods used at the JRC are “torture” in violation of international human rights standards.  \n",
      " Please see the short video of Andre McCollins strapped down on a restraint board by lock and key, and shocked repeatedly over seven hours.  It's hard to watch but the video shows Andre, who has autism, being being shocked for refusing to take off his coat. He was embarrassed that he had been forced to wear the clothes of another student that morning that he was concealing with his jacket, and people with autism sometimes have difficulty with change.  \n",
      " Andre was shocked an additional 19 times that day for tensing his muscles while being tortured (tensing muscles reduces the amount of pain), and he was shocked 9 times for yelling and screaming for the shocks to stop, all in response to being shocked.  JRC listed \"full body tense up\" as a \"health dangerous behavior\", and yelling and screaming - \"Someone, help me, please!\" as a \"major disruptive behavior,\" even though Andre was strapped to the board as this was happening!   \n",
      " The treatment that Andre received was not unique.  JRC's lawyers testified in court that staff did their jobs well that day by following Andre's program.  While I was an employee at JRC, I observed many students being tied up on restraint boards and restraint chairs and shocked repeatedly.  In some rooms, three students might be tied to restraint boards getting shocked at the same time.  The lower-functioning nonverbal students were often shocked up to the maximum of 30 shocks per day, resulting in so many bloody and crusty scabs all over students' arms, legs, torsos, and fingers, that there was nowhere left to place the electrodes without burning through old scabs and burns.  \n",
      " Students at JRC are not only shocked for severe behavior problems. I was forced to shock certain students for even the most minor behaviors such as pulling apart a loose piece of thread, tearing a used paper cup, standing up to give a teacher a hug, or standing up and raising a hand politely to ask to go to the bathroom. Many of the lower-functioning nonverbal students lived and reacted in constant fear and anxiety.   \n",
      " When they observed their peers being shocked, and even when they saw a teacher reaching for a pencil in their pocket that was close to the remote control buttons that activate the shock devices, these students in their extreme anxiety would stand up out of their seat, yell in fear, throw down their task, or pull their own electrodes off of their skin -- and are then shocked for these reactions.  A young man with autism was shocked for closing his eyes for more than 10 seconds while sitting at his desk.  As part of her behavioral plan, a beautiful nonverbal blind girl with cerebral palsy was shocked for attempting to hold the hand of any staff, which was her only means to communicate and to be loved. The same student was also shocked according to her behavioral plan for \"loud moaning,\" and later it was discovered she had a cracked tooth and that her loud moaning had been her many attempts to communicate that she was in severe pain!  \n",
      " In 2006, the New York State Education Department (NYSED) wrote a detailed report that included descriptions of highly abusive and questionable interventions (which have not been systematically studied and have not been reported in the empirical literature) against New York State students, but was unable to pull students out of the JRC due to the threat of costly litigation and to JRC’s deliberate misleading of New York State authorities.  In 2011, Dr. Matthew Israel, the founder and the Executive Director of the JRC, was indicted by a grand jury for the obstruction of justice by destroying evidence related to the use of his GED-shock devices, which had caused severe injuries to students.  The plea agreement reached with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts resulted in his resignation (he now resides in California), and five years’ probation.  \n",
      " Parents of students still at JRC and certain state authorities are misled to think that only severe pain and torture can help their children.  Schools exist across the country and globe that serve students who have very similar needs to students at JRC.  Students at JRC are not unique to the rest of the world, but only JRC specializes in severe pain and acts of torture.  Already New York State has returned some of its students to New York from JRC.  \n",
      " Please ban all aversive shock devices in America and bring America into compliance with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 5: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”  How can America ask other countries to comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights if America does not also comply? \n",

      " Hundreds of thousands of calves and lambs are brought to Israel annually by sea and by air from Australia and Europe for fattening, slaughter and some for fresh meat. Their lengthy and painful journey at sea, during which they are trapped in pens, densely soaked with droppings and feces, their own and their companions, the intense heat, noise and sea sickness, all contribute to their immense suffering, and are only a portion of their journey . The journeys beforehand in trucks, afterwards in trucks, the many loading and unloading to holding pens, quarantine areas, along with the endless cruelty they are subjected to along the way (beatings, electrical shockers etc.) cause some to die along the way, and some more to get sick. \n",
      " The bodies of ill or dead animals are thrown at sea. \n",
      " Live Export Shipments are harmful to the environment. Not only are they a major factor in the pollution of air, water and land resources and bio-diversity damage, they also harm the marine ecosystem due to the huge amounts of feces and animal corpses thrown into the sea. Some of the corpses drift to beaches (including Israel's shores). \n",

      "UPDATE:  There are still too many unanswered questions and other things surfacing in the public that needs to be investigated.   Heartbreaking news at the discovery of Noah's body. This is so tragic. There are so many people out there who still want an investigation into this child's death from other officials besides local officials. Let's keep this petition going to make sure Noah has fair and objective views into this case and his soul may rest in peace. We are requesting the FBI to step in and make sure this case is being handled thoroughly, with fair and unbiased views. An autopsy out of the local area also needs to be performed. You may also email the Nashville or Memphis FBI office for any concerns. Feel free to post any concerns in the comments as well. We are Noah's only voice.... ======================================================== \n",
      " No Signs of Noah Chamberlin in this Winter Weather, 2-Year-Old Tennessee Toddler Missing Since Thursday, January 14th when one family member took Noah and his 4-year old sister Hiking and lost sight of the toddler.  Officials have been quoted as saying, \"The woods surrounding the boy's home is filled with creeks and rough terrain.\"  After a week of search teams, seasoned investigators and numerous thoroughly trained dogs, there's still no sign of Noah.   We want to find Noah. We feel the local authorities are too close to the family for various reasons, and it's a conflict of interest.  We are asking the FBI to take over this case and explore all avenues.  So far the media is giving different stories from the family on how this could have happened.  Experts, K-9's & volunteers have been searching the same area for a week now, with not even a scent uncovered.  The public just wants to find Noah, and we trust the FBI to explore the case both, thoroughly and objectively.  Please help Noah. Thank you. https://www.facebook.com/wreg3/videos/1225233784171992/?theater\n",

      "Ban animal testing in Canada\n",
      "We must work toward phasing out the use of any and all animals for any testing for any purpose. Although it would seem easier to use animals, we are realizing it is cruel and we have no right to do so. Alternatives must be created and discovered, regardless the cost increase. \n",
      " Our advances in medicine and animal care have come at the expense of millions of animal test subjects over hundreds of years, performed by scientists from various countries. What we thought of acceptable experimentation on animals is now being regarded as a violation of humane treatment. Animal testing gave us the knowledge we have now, but it does not need to continue this way. \n",
      " \"Vivisection (from Latin vivus, meaning \"alive\", and sectio, meaning \"cutting\") is surgery conducted for experimental purposes on a living organism, typically animals with a central nervous system, to view living internal structure.\" \n",
      " Guidelines for animal testing have included methodology such as: \n",
      " \"The Three Rs \n",
      " \"The Three Rs (3Rs) are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing. These were first described by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch in 1959. \n",
      " \"The 3Rs are: \n",
      " \"Replacement which refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims. These methods include computer modeling. Reduction which refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals. Refinement which refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. These methods include non-invasive techniques. \n",
      " \"The 3Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided.* These 3Rs are now implemented in many testing establishments worldwide and have been adopted by various pieces of legislation and regulations. \n",
      " (*Invertebrates could be a possible substitution for assistance to phase-out animal usage.) \n",
      " \"Despite the widespread acceptance of the 3Rs, many countries—including Canada, Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Germany—have reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and, in some cases, fish while reporting declines in the use of cats, dogs, primates, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Along with other countries, China has also escalated its use of GM animals,* resulting in an increase in overall animal use. \n",
      " (*Genetically modified) \n",
      " As we know, The Quebec national assembly has passed legislation that better protects animals and defines them as sentient beings. With this shift in thinking, Canada should further make use of the momentum by taking a larger step: no longer using animals for any testing. \n",
      " The changes needed for this can be gradual. New policies will need to be drafted. But Canada can become a world leader in animal rights and welfare. once new practices are employed. \n",

      "total boycott of Israel\n",
      "Sir, \n",
      " The whole world is witness to aggression and injustice perpetrated by Israel on the Palestinian people. Last year in the 51 days of brutal attack against the besieged Gaza city more than 2200 Palestinians died which included more than 500 children. 11,000 people were wounded or maimed including almost 3000 children. Three-fourth of the dead were civilians. More than 500,000 people were displaced and most of these are still not rehabilitated because the Israeli Zionists have been obstructing all attempts to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals and restore supply of electricity, water and medicines.  Israeli attacks against Gaza and the Palestinian people are still continuing unabated. Palestinian villages are being demolished to make way for colonies of Israeli settlers. Despite worldwide condemnation and mass protests the Zionists with the full backing of US imperialism are going ahead with their insane campaign of genocide of a people. \n",
      "             Public opinion all over the world has turned against Israel. The BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement is putting tremendous pressure on Israeli government and companies. Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel is also gaining widespread support. Several countries have already condemned the apartheid policies of Israel and have severed all relations with it and some countries have even declared Israel a terrorist state. \n",
      "             In this scenario, it is a matter of embarrassment for all justice loving and sensitive Indian citizens that our government has become one of the biggest supporters of the Zionist murderers. India has already become the single largest buyer of Israeli armaments and Israel is now the second biggest supplier of arms to India. We feel a sense of anger and shame that Indian taxpayers' money is being used to kill children and innocent people in Palestine. \n",
      "              We demand: \n",
      " 1.      The proposed visit of the Indian Prime Minister to Israel be cancelled. \n",
      " 2.      The Indian government must sever all diplomatic, military, intelligence and trade ties with Israel. The Israeli embassy in New Delhi be closed and the Indian ambassador in Tel Aviv be recalled. \n",
      " 3.      All the state governments should also cancel all MOUs signed or proposed with Israel. \n",
      " 4.      Israel's apartheid policies and aggression must be condemned on all international fora by India and the demand of a unified secular Palestine state must be supported.  \n",

      " Immigration Authority inspectors visited a farm in the North on Monday  and told the two parents that they must leave the country within a week(!), because they had received a place to sleep and that was considered equal to \"Money\"! \n",
      " Later the inspectors stated that the visitors needed a volunteer visa. It certainly seems that they were simply trying to find reasons to get these people to leave the country. We can only imagine that it was ignorance of the WWOOF cause, on part of the inspectors, that they considered these volunteers to be such a threat: \n",
      " Dear Ministry of the Interior, WWOOF began 40 years ago in England and every year 100,000 people volunteer in over 50 countries around the world; they do it because it is a wonderful experience, an opportunity where they can learn about organic farming, get to know a local family, help small farmers that have no money to pay for employees, and, as a bonus, it is also a wonderful way to travel the world while helping others! \n",
      " How can it be that in Israel, a country that places so much value on community, you would tell people that they are being deported for volunteering, let alone telling them this in the presence of 6-year old children, who are learning such an important lesson about volunteer work and helping others?! \n",
      " For the last eight years, thousands of volunteers have come to Israel and every day we (WWOOF Israel) get calls from farmers that tell us how wonderful this initiative is. It has been so popular in fact, that by now there are some 80 hosts already - farms and kibbutzim, scattered right across the country from the South to the North of Israel. The WWOOF site also has 259 testimonials of volunteers, saying what an amazing experience they had in Israel. \n",
      " Is it really the intention of the government to stop all of this wonderful work now?? \n",

       "'(English below) Queridos Caetano e Gil, \\n Com admiração ao trabalho de vocês e seu histórico de comprometimento com lutas pela liberdade, justiça e igualdade, pedimos que cancelem vosso show em Israel, previsto para 28 de julho. A data coincide com o aniversário de um ano dos ataques de Israel a Gaza, nos quais mais de 2 mil palestinas e palestinos foram mortos, incluindo mais 500 crianças. Ainda hoje, mais de 100 mil pessoas seguem desabrigadas em decorrência da ofensiva. \\n Tocar em Israel é endossar políticas e práticas racistas, coloniais e de apartheid -ilegais sob o direito internacional. Ademais, o governo israelense apresenta os shows em Israel como um sinal de aprovação a suas políticas. Israel viola sistematicamente o direito internacional ao impedir o retorno dos refugiados palestinos, ao colonizar e ocupar a Cisjordânia e a Faixa de Gaza e ao discriminar sistematicamente os palestinos cidadãos de Israel. As políticas discriminatórias de Israel também se manifestam contra refugiados e migrantes africanos: recentemente milhares de etíopes foram brutalmente reprimidos ao protestarem contra o racismo no país. \\n Nosso pedido faz coro ao chamado de artistas e da sociedade civil palestina para que artistas não se apresentem em Israel. Entre aqueles que responderam a esse chamado, cancelando seus shows no país, estão Lauryn Hill, Roger Waters (Pink Floyd), Snoop Dog, Carlos Santana, Cold Play, Lenny Kravitz e Elvis Costello. \\n O arcebisbo sul-africano Desmond Tutu, Nobel da Paz, é um importante apoiador desse chamado e explica que apresentar-se em Tel Aviv é errado “assim como dissémos que era inapropriado para artistas internacionais tocarem na África do Sul durante o apartheid, em uma sociedade fundada em leis discriminatórias e exclusividade racial”. Se apresentar em Israel seria como fazer um show em Sun City na Africa do Sul do apartheid. \\n Não ignorem esse chamado. Tropicália não combina com apartheid! \\n \\xa0-- \\n Dear Caetano and Gill, \\n With admiration to your work and historical commitment with struggles for justice, freedom and equality, we ask you to cancel your concert in Tel Aviv, scheduled for July 28. July will mark the one year anniversary of the Israeli attacks against Gaza during which Israel killed more than 2,000 Palestinians, including over 500 children. More than 100,000 remain homeless due to these attacks. \\n Performing in Israel serves as a stamp of approval for Israel’s illegal racist, colonial and apartheid policies. The Israeli government portrays concerts in Israel as a sign of support for its policies. Israel systematically violates international law: it prevents Palestinian refugees from returning to their homes, it colonises and occupies the West Bank and Gaza, and it systematically discriminates against Palestinian citizens of Israel. And it’s not just Palestinians that face Israeli oppression: thousands of Ethiopian migrants were recently brutally repressed for protesting against racism in Israel. \\n Our request echoes Palestinian artists and civil society, who are calling for artists not to perform in Israel. Artists that have answered this call include Lauryn Hill, Roger Waters (Pink Floyd), Snoop Dog, Carlos Santana, Cold Play, Lenny Kravitz and Elvis Costello. \\n The South African Nobel Prize winner, archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is an important supporter of the Palestinian call for boycott, has explained that performing in Tel Aviv is wrong, “just as we said during apartheid that it was inappropriate for international artists to perform in South Africa in a society founded on discriminatory laws and racial exclusivity”. Performing in Israel today is the equivalent of performing in Sun City South Africa during the apartheid era. \\n Do not ignore this call. Supporting apartheid isn’t the Tropicalia way!'"
