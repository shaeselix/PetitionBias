 Com admiração ao trabalho de vocês e seu histórico de comprometimento com lutas pela liberdade, justiça e igualdade, pedimos que cancelem vosso show em Israel, previsto para 28 de julho. A data coincide com o aniversário de um ano dos ataques de Israel a Gaza, nos quais mais de 2 mil palestinas e palestinos foram mortos, incluindo mais 500 crianças. Ainda hoje, mais de 100 mil pessoas seguem desabrigadas em decorrência da ofensiva. 
 Tocar em Israel é endossar políticas e práticas racistas, coloniais e de apartheid -ilegais sob o direito internacional. Ademais, o governo israelense apresenta os shows em Israel como um sinal de aprovação a suas políticas. Israel viola sistematicamente o direito internacional ao impedir o retorno dos refugiados palestinos, ao colonizar e ocupar a Cisjordânia e a Faixa de Gaza e ao discriminar sistematicamente os palestinos cidadãos de Israel. As políticas discriminatórias de Israel também se manifestam contra refugiados e migrantes africanos: recentemente milhares de etíopes foram brutalmente reprimidos ao protestarem contra o racismo no país. 
 Nosso pedido faz coro ao chamado de artistas e da sociedade civil palestina para que artistas não se apresentem em Israel. Entre aqueles que responderam a esse chamado, cancelando seus shows no país, estão Lauryn Hill, Roger Waters (Pink Floyd), Snoop Dog, Carlos Santana, Cold Play, Lenny Kravitz e Elvis Costello. 
 O arcebisbo sul-africano Desmond Tutu, Nobel da Paz, é um importante apoiador desse chamado e explica que apresentar-se em Tel Aviv é errado “assim como dissémos que era inapropriado para artistas internacionais tocarem na África do Sul durante o apartheid, em uma sociedade fundada em leis discriminatórias e exclusividade racial”. Se apresentar em Israel seria como fazer um show em Sun City na Africa do Sul do apartheid. 
 Não ignorem esse chamado. Tropicália não combina com apartheid! 
  -- 
 Dear Caetano and Gill, 
 With admiration to your work and historical commitment with struggles for justice, freedom and equality, we ask you to cancel your concert in Tel Aviv, scheduled for July 28. July will mark the one year anniversary of the Israeli attacks against Gaza during which Israel killed more than 2,000 Palestinians, including over 500 children. More than 100,000 remain homeless due to these attacks. 
 Performing in Israel serves as a stamp of approval for Israel’s illegal racist, colonial and apartheid policies. The Israeli government portrays concerts in Israel as a sign of support for its policies. Israel systematically violates international law: it prevents Palestinian refugees from returning to their homes, it colonises and occupies the West Bank and Gaza, and it systematically discriminates against Palestinian citizens of Israel. And it’s not just Palestinians that face Israeli oppression: thousands of Ethiopian migrants were recently brutally repressed for protesting against racism in Israel. 
 Our request echoes Palestinian artists and civil society, who are calling for artists not to perform in Israel. Artists that have answered this call include Lauryn Hill, Roger Waters (Pink Floyd), Snoop Dog, Carlos Santana, Cold Play, Lenny Kravitz and Elvis Costello. 
 The South African Nobel Prize winner, archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is an important supporter of the Palestinian call for boycott, has explained that performing in Tel Aviv is wrong, “just as we said during apartheid that it was inappropriate for international artists to perform in South Africa in a society founded on discriminatory laws and racial exclusivity”. Performing in Israel today is the equivalent of performing in Sun City South Africa during the apartheid era.

 Although the European Union has evidence that calves from its member states are being cruelly treated, and endure journeys that break the law, it does nothing.  The lucky ones are the ones that die en route.

 b) Israel is not part of Europe or the European Union.

I am a retired U.S. Navy Veteran and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivor. And like many other victims in the military, I was harassed, and humiliated by my Chain of Command after reporting my abuse. But a bipartisan bill before the U.S. Senate right now can completely change how sexual assaults in the military are handled - the Military Justice Improvement Act.  
 As it stands now, any U.S. Military personnel, male or female, who are sexually assaulted or harassed are at the mercy of their own Commanding Officers who have full jurisdiction and discretion in prosecuting these cases.  In many of the cases the perpetrator is not prosecuted while the victim is treated as the criminal, ostracized and harassed by their own command and often their military service stands in jeopardy. This is why so many assaults go unreported. 
 Even though I was raped while in the Navy, my case it is a story of command harassment.  During a 5 year period I was harassed, by my command because the Maintenance Officer didn't want ""women in his Navy"".  Between being raped and continuously harassed I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2001.  I was raped and it was traumatizing, but the most devastating thing was the Command Harassment. 
 The Military Justice Improvement Act (S. 967) changes this by taking the Commanding Officer out of the case and providing a specialized legal group in charge of investigating and prosecuting these cases. This is a common sense step that our closest allies, including the UK, Canada, Australia and Israel, have made to their militaries.  
 The Military Justice Improvement Act has bipartisan support but needs more votes to pass and it will be voted on this week. Your Senator needs to hear from you about this important bill now!  
 I spent 20 years trying to run away from the hell the Navy put me though. I was told that all of my problems were between my ears. They tried to Court Marshal me, they harassed me on a daily basis, and when I was transferred the harassment continued because my perpetrator picked up the phone and had me labeled a troublemaker before I even checked in.  If the Military Justice Improvement Act had been passed then, that wouldn't have happened to me.  
 Help us get the word to Congress that the rape culture in the military is still prevalent.  Tell them we will no longer allow our men and women in the military to be raped, tell them that we WILL hold them accountable.  
 I am taking a stand against the unjust persecution of my brothers and sisters that are victims of MST and harassment. Please join me by asking your Senator to support the Military Justice Improvement Act. ",Petitioning Representative Patrick Murphy,,131188.0,0.0

 Their struggle started in 2014, during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. No one could get to the animals to feed them. Some, including a beautiful Bengal Tiger, died waiting for food. Now, conditions for the creatures that have survived the fighting are dire. 
 The region’s people are having a hard time finding food, let alone the animals. The zoo is not bringing in revenue anymore, as almost no one visits since the fighting began. Staff have taken to stuffing the animals that die and putting them back on display, to maintain the facade of a lively zoo. 
 These animals are innocent, and should not be victims of the war. An agency called Four Paws is currently working to try and secure the release of these animals.  Please join me and ask the South Jungle Zoo to consider working with Four Paws to secure the release of the surviving animals to qualified aid organizations, sanctuaries or zoos in more stable regions. 
 Many of these animals are already endangered, and to drag them through such suffering is senseless. Of the six ostriches, only one is still alive. The lions and the only llama died in December. There are no more crocodiles. One tiger remains, and the owner was recently quoted saying it had not eaten in four or five days. 
 Half of the remaining 20 or so animals and birds in the zoo are ill due to lack of veterinary care. We must act now to save them. 
 Let’s implore the South Jungle Zoo’s owner to release all of his surviving animals to qualified organizations and sanctuaries that can nurse them back to health. It is their only hope.",Petitioning  South Jungle Zoo,,130095.0,0.0

 The white South African population currently faces ethnic cleansing and persecutions at the hands of the ANC government, the EFF, and various individual anti-white aggressors. Over 4000 white farmers have been brutally murdered, often including torture and rape and mutilation. Many white South Africans today live in poverty and squalor as a consequence of the ANC government's Black Economic Empowerment policy which shuts whites out of the labour pool. 
 Based on the Israeli government's policy of allowing all Jews the right to return to Israel, we believe it is not only advisable but morally obligatory that Europe should allow all white South Africans the right to return. 
 As it currently stands, many white South Africans who try to apply for citizenship to European countries such as the Netherlands and UK are rejected. Many of these white South Africans seeking citizenship are direct descendants of the very same European nations that reject them. 
 Obviously certain details of this policy are subject to deliberation. For instance, whether the white South Africans would have the right to return to any European nation of their choosing, or if they would specifically have the right to return to whatever nation the majority of their ancestry is from (which in most cases would be the Netherlands or UK). 
 Also this would extend to whites in Zimbabwe and Namibia, given that they face a similar situation.

The problem is the immigration of large numbers of improperly vetted people from regions where violent Islamic unrest is endemic.

 Israel is using Eurovision Song context as a propaganda tool. 
 It is to choose the side of the oppressor if EBU allow them with silent consent. 
 In 2005, Nissim Ben-Sheetrit of Israel’s Foreign Ministry emphasised: ""We see culture as a propaganda tool of the first rank, and I do not differentiate between between propaganda and culture"". Israel is guilty of crimes against humanity and its artists are considered by their apartheid regime to be its ambassadors. Shall EBU allow it by silent consent? We say  NO  of course not! 
  In 2006, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched an multi-million dollar initiative called “Brand Israel,” whereby culture is used to whitewash an apartheid state founded on the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and occupation of their land. Arye Mekel of Israel’s Foreign Ministry explained “We willsend well-known novelists and writers overseas, theatre companies, exhibits… This way you show Israel’s prettier face, so we are not thought of purely in the context of war.” Shall EBU contribute to the hiding of the ugly truth, by pretending it doesn't exist? We say  NO  of course not. 
 In 2008, Israeli poet Yitzhak Laor explained the contacts Israeli artists going abroad with foreign Ministry funding have to sign includes a 'Brand Israel' clause that [the artist] ""is aware that the purpose of ordering services from him is to promote the policy interest of the State of Israel via culture and art, including contributing to creating a positive image for Israel"" furthermore it stipulatesthat this relationship must remain secret. 
 Israelis such as EX Zionists Professor Ilan Pappe author of The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, Miko Peled Author of The Generals Son, are ashamed of Apartheid Israel and are leaving Israel in droves. Jewish people all across the world are calling on you to help end the apartheid  
 racism of the Zionist state by signing the petition calling on the organisers of the Eurovision Song Competition to EXPEL apartheid Israel from the competition. 
 Palestinian artists and musicians are routinely prevented from performing abroad as the result when Israel often refuses to allow Palestinians to cross military checkpoints leading to a dead end instead of the airport. 
 On 9 March 2012, for instance, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called ( http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/CERD.C.ISR.CO.14-16.pdf ) on Israel to end its racist policies and laws that contravene the prohibition against racial segregation and apartheid. 
 But it is the massacres of the innocents, such as the 538 of last July and the massacre of 29 members of the Samouni Family, in cold blood and other acts of inhumanity that are so utterly objectionable, that right thinking artists shouldn't perform with, organises should not allow into song competitions, and members of the public should not watch without consideration for thedeath and destruction to innocent lives. 
 The 2014 ""WAR"" was a massacre of 2011 civilians at least 538 innocent children and the permanent maiming of 1000 more children and the wilful demolition of 58,000 homes leaving 130,000 innocent people homeless. 
 Shall EBU pretend as if Israel never did this? Shall EBU allow Israel to wave the flag of the oppressor in the face of all the Palestinian viewers, many as refugees in Europe, and human rights activists and right minded people? We say NO. We urge you to do the same.

The water problem is YOUR FAULT!,Elias C,"We have done our part. We have installed water saving toilets, shower-heads, sprinklers, faucets, etc. We have reduced our water consumption dramatically and are paying exorbitant fees for water and taxes. Enough is enough! 
  On the other hand,  YOU have done nothing  to prepare the State for water shortages and increased population. Blaming the weather is flatout irresponsible. You had plenty of warning. Our water system is old and not capable of sustaining growth or lack of rain. 
 1. Time for YOU to get to work.  Find ways to bring water to the State: 
 
 Water desalinization – Better, efficient, solar-powered technology is available now. The biggest ocean in the world is right next to us. 
  Waterpipe from Oregon/Washington States. The Columbia River dumps millions of gallons of water to the ocean everyday. Find a way to buy that water and build a pipeline to supply our aqueducts. 
  Talented American engineers are working in the Middle East turning deserts into tropical paradises. Consult with them. The technology is available. 
 
 2. Every action has an Equal and Opposite Reaction!  Your mandate for us to cut our water usage by 25% will have serious and irreversible effects to our Eco-system: 
 
  We spent years planting trees, grass and plants, making our cars more efficient and reducing pollution to clean our air quality. We can’t go back to pollution. 
  Air quality and greenhouse gases will create a man-made climate change. By reducing the irrigation of our gardens, we will be killing our grass, plants and trees. This will reduce the amount of oxygen producing organisms and increase our CO2 levels affecting our greenhouse gases, damaging our air quality and increasing the number of people suffering from respiratory and pulmonary diseases. 
 Reduced production of healthy California produce:  You are asking farmers to decrease their water usage. This will also reduce the amount of produce grown in California and kill our farming industry. The unacceptable alternative would be to import produce from China and other non-FDA regulated countries that use dangerous pesticides and fertilizers. You will seriously harm our health! 
 California is one of the most beautiful states in the Nation. By destroying our gardens and trees, our property values will decrease. This will have negative consequences by reducing the amount the State and local municipalities collect in taxes. 
 The reduced consumption or water will increase water pressure and instability in the old pipes and infrastructure in our larger cities. Bursts underground pipes waste more water per minute than the water we could “save” by reducing our water usage in weeks. 
 
 Your punishing actions and unacceptable mediocrity are driving people away from California. STOP! 
 3. Money is NOT an issue: 
 
 You have budgeted billions of dollars to build a high-speed train, support entitlements for undocumented workers and unnecessary government projects and bureaucracy.  This is an EMERGENCY. Re-allocate funds to get water into our States NOW! 
 The State is collecting unprecedented and unfair amounts of money in the “Global Warming Tax”.  Use this money to prevent further global warming. We need our plants, trees and grass to reduce CO2 levels and prevent further climate change. 
 Initiate investigations into corruption, nepotism and waste of resources in ALL of the State’s water agencies.  For example: Do we really need over 5,000 people making over $130,000 per year in salary in the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power?  200 of them make over $250,000 per year.  This is flat out corruption! 
 
 4. Mediocrity is UNACCEPTABLE: 
 
  California is the world leader when it comes to innovation, technology and human progress. We have some of the best research universities in the world like Caltech, USC, Stanford, Berkeley and others. Some of the best technology companies and the brightest minds in the world are headquartered in California.  Start an immediate program to fund research and solutions for the water mismanagement problem. 
 Bring engineers and consultants from Israel to train our farmers on the water utilization techniques they use. 
 Just like Space X did it for space travel, create a State-funded contest and with a prize of $10 million dollars to the entity or individual that can find better solutions.  
 
 With all these resources at your disposal, it is just impossible to believe that the only solution you can find is to further punish the citizens for your mistakes and lack of action.

 A long and completely avoidable history of violence by police officers has killed too many innocent civilians, caused a destructive level of mistrust in the community, and is causing a rising tide of anger, frustration, and despair among millions of good people. 
 This petition is for Amadou Diallo  - shot at 41 times. An innocent, hardworking man simply reaching for his wallet, Diallo should be alive today. 
 This petition is for Sean Bell  - shot at over 50 times and killed on his wedding day.  
 This petition is for Oscar Grant  - handcuffed with his hands behind his back for breaking a fight on the subway - Oscar was shot in the back and killed by a police officer while sitting down. 
 This petition is for Chavis Carter  - arrested for marijuana, searched, handcuffed with his hands behind his back, and put into the back of a police car. Chavis is then said to have somehow killed himself with a gun.  
 This petition is for Wendell Allen  - just 20 years old - police busted into a house and shot him in the heart - killing him. He wasn't who they were looking for. 
 This petition is for Rekia Boyd  - an unarmed Black woman shot and killed because an officer thought her cell phone was a gun. 
 This petition is for Luis Rodriguez  - an unarmed father who was beaten and choked to death in front of his family for not showing his ID outside a movie theater. 
 This petition is for Eric Garner  - choked to death on YouTube for the entire world to see. While the coroner has deemed his death a homicide, we must change the laws to prevent this from ever happening again. 
 This petition is for Israel Hernandez  - a young artist that was murdered by Miami Beach Police Department after he was caught tagging an abandoned building. 
 This petition is for Mike Brown  - unarmed and shot to death in Ferguson, Missouri, we are still waiting for even the basic answers here. 
 We encourage you to Google these names and cases for yourself. 
 This petition is for these men, and for many other unarmed men and women who have been killed by the police.  It is unacceptable for the police to serve as JUDGE, JURY, and EXECUTIONER.  The recent murders of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and John Crawford this past month at the hands of police have so inflamed communities across the country that we believe we are reaching a tipping point of anger. 
 It is our hope to channel this collective anger into effective policy solutions that will not only make life safer for citizens, but will restore confidence in police, and bring hope to hopeless families and communities devastated by these egregious acts of violence. 
 Our 6 National Hands Up Demands are: 
 1. Obama needs to “Do the Right Thing” and go to Ferguson and meet with local black and brown youth. 2. Eric Holder meet with local black and brown youth across the country who are dealing with “Zero Tolerance” and “Broken Windows” policing.   3. Ensure transparency, accountability, and safety of our communities, by requiring front-facing cameras on police departments with records of racial disparity in stops, arrest, killings, and excessive force complaints. 4. Cops need consequences too. Police officers who discharge their weapon on an unarmed person should be suspended without pay pending further investigation. And their name and policing histories should be made available to the public. 5. Tanks and tear gas don’t ever belong in our communities. America should not be going to war with it’s citizens. Demilitarize all police departments. 6. Police should be representative of the communities they are tasked to protect and serve and community members should have  real  power  in citizen review boards. 
   
 Our 7 Policy Solutions Are As Follows: 
 1. The avoidable shooting and killing or otherwise murdering of an unarmed citizen who does not have an outstanding warrant for a violent crime should be a federal offense. 
 2. Choke holds and chest compressions by police (what the coroner lists as the official cause of death for Eric Garner) should be federally banned. 
 3. All police officers must wear forward-facing body cameras while on duty. They cost just $99 and are having a significant, positive impact in several cities around the United States and the world. Turning them off should warrant immediate termination.   
 4. A trusted 3rd party business should monitor and store all videos from forward facing cameras. 
 5. Suspensions for violations of any of the above offenses should be UNPAID. If a third party review board clears the officer, the back pay, which could sit in escrow could be given back to the officer. If found guilty, the money in escrow should be given to victims of police violence. 
 6. All murders by police must be investigated, immediately so, by a trusted and unbiased third party. It is not sufficient for the police, who are like a family, to investigate a murder by one of their own. 
 7. Convictions for the above offenses should have their own set of mandatory minimum penalties. The men who killed Diallo, Bell, Grant, Carter, Garner, and others all walk free while over 1,000,000 non violent offenders are currently incarcerated in American prisons. 
 These federal actions are in the best interest of our country. We will direct our anger, our dollars, our votes, and our voice to seeing them happen all across the country. ",Petitioning President Barack Obama,"A long and completely avoidable history of violence by police officers has killed too many innocent civilians, caused a destructive level of mistrust in the community, and is causing a rising tide of anger, frustration, and despair among millions of good people.

All police officers must wear forward-facing body cameras while on duty. They cost just $99 and are having a significant, positive impact in several cities around the United States and the world. Turning them off should warrant immediate termination.  4. A trusted 3rd party business should monitor and store all videos from forward facing cameras. 5. Suspensions for violations of any of the above offenses should be UNPAID. If a third party review board clears the officer, the back pay, which could sit in escrow could be given back to the officer. If found guilty, the money in escrow should be given to prevent further police violence. 6. All murders by police must be investigated, immediately so, by a trusted and unbiased third party. It is not sufficient for the police, who are like a family, to investigate a murder by one of their own. 7. Convictions for the above offenses should have their own set of mandatory minimum penalties. The men who killed Diallo, Bell, Grant, Carter, Garner, and others all walk free while over 1,000,000 non violent offenders are currently incarcerated in American prisons. These federal actions are in the best interest of our country. We will direct our anger, our dollars, our votes, and our voice to seeing them happen all across the country.",260628.0,0.0
30,1491487.0,https://www.change.org/p/ban-torturous-shock-devices-used-on-special-needs-people,Please ban torturous shock devices used on special needs people,Gregory Miller,"I deeply regret having worked as a teacher’s assistant at The Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC), a “special needs school” in Canton, Massachusetts, where children and teenagers with autism and other disabilities are administered electric shocks as a means of controlling their behaviors.   
 I joined the JRC because I thought I would be helping these special needs students.  But it became clear that this practice was painful, traumatic, and more harmful than good. I never would have used these ""GED"" shock devices had JRC not told me and other staff in training that the GEDs had been “approved by the FDA”.  When asking an administrator about the severe thick and bloodied scabby injuries all over students' bodies, I was told that these machines had been tested and were “proven to be safe” as necessary to get FDA approval.  I did not know until 2012 that this was a lie! 
 The human rights abuses taking place at the JRC are well documented.  In 2013, the United Nations in “Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. Méndez,” unequivocally stated that the methods used at the JRC are “torture” in violation of international human rights standards.  
 Please see the short video of Andre McCollins strapped down on a restraint board by lock and key, and shocked repeatedly over seven hours.  It's hard to watch but the video shows Andre, who has autism, being being shocked for refusing to take off his coat. He was embarrassed that he had been forced to wear the clothes of another student that morning that he was concealing with his jacket, and people with autism sometimes have difficulty with change.  
 Andre was shocked an additional 19 times that day for tensing his muscles while being tortured (tensing muscles reduces the amount of pain), and he was shocked 9 times for yelling and screaming for the shocks to stop, all in response to being shocked.  JRC listed ""full body tense up"" as a ""health dangerous behavior"", and yelling and screaming - ""Someone, help me, please!"" as a ""major disruptive behavior,"" even though Andre was strapped to the board as this was happening!   
 The treatment that Andre received was not unique.  JRC's lawyers testified in court that staff did their jobs well that day by following Andre's program.  While I was an employee at JRC, I observed many students being tied up on restraint boards and restraint chairs and shocked repeatedly.  In some rooms, three students might be tied to restraint boards getting shocked at the same time.  The lower-functioning nonverbal students were often shocked up to the maximum of 30 shocks per day, resulting in so many bloody and crusty scabs all over students' arms, legs, torsos, and fingers, that there was nowhere left to place the electrodes without burning through old scabs and burns.  
 Students at JRC are not only shocked for severe behavior problems. I was forced to shock certain students for even the most minor behaviors such as pulling apart a loose piece of thread, tearing a used paper cup, standing up to give a teacher a hug, or standing up and raising a hand politely to ask to go to the bathroom. Many of the lower-functioning nonverbal students lived and reacted in constant fear and anxiety.   
 When they observed their peers being shocked, and even when they saw a teacher reaching for a pencil in their pocket that was close to the remote control buttons that activate the shock devices, these students in their extreme anxiety would stand up out of their seat, yell in fear, throw down their task, or pull their own electrodes off of their skin -- and are then shocked for these reactions.  A young man with autism was shocked for closing his eyes for more than 10 seconds while sitting at his desk.  As part of her behavioral plan, a beautiful nonverbal blind girl with cerebral palsy was shocked for attempting to hold the hand of any staff, which was her only means to communicate and to be loved. The same student was also shocked according to her behavioral plan for ""loud moaning,"" and later it was discovered she had a cracked tooth and that her loud moaning had been her many attempts to communicate that she was in severe pain!  
 In 2006, the New York State Education Department (NYSED) wrote a detailed report that included descriptions of highly abusive and questionable interventions (which have not been systematically studied and have not been reported in the empirical literature) against New York State students, but was unable to pull students out of the JRC due to the threat of costly litigation and to JRC’s deliberate misleading of New York State authorities.  In 2011, Dr. Matthew Israel, the founder and the Executive Director of the JRC, was indicted by a grand jury for the obstruction of justice by destroying evidence related to the use of his GED-shock devices, which had caused severe injuries to students.  The plea agreement reached with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts resulted in his resignation (he now resides in California), and five years’ probation.  
 Parents of students still at JRC and certain state authorities are misled to think that only severe pain and torture can help their children.  Schools exist across the country and globe that serve students who have very similar needs to students at JRC.  Students at JRC are not unique to the rest of the world, but only JRC specializes in severe pain and acts of torture.  Already New York State has returned some of its students to New York from JRC.  
 Please ban all aversive shock devices in America and bring America into compliance with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 5: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”  How can America ask other countries to comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights if America does not also comply? ","Petitioning Food and Drug Administration FDA Neurological Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, Docket ID: FDA-2014-N-0238",Please ban torturous shock devices used on special needs people,188055.0,0.0

 Live Export Shipments: Cruel to Animals, Detrimental to the Environment and a Health Hazard to Humans! 
 Hundreds of thousands of calves and lambs are brought to Israel annually by sea and by air from Australia and Europe for fattening, slaughter and some for fresh meat. Their lengthy and painful journey at sea, during which they are trapped in pens, densely soaked with droppings and feces, their own and their companions, the intense heat, noise and sea sickness, all contribute to their immense suffering, and are only a portion of their journey . The journeys beforehand in trucks, afterwards in trucks, the many loading and unloading to holding pens, quarantine areas, along with the endless cruelty they are subjected to along the way (beatings, electrical shockers etc.) cause some to die along the way, and some more to get sick. 
 The bodies of ill or dead animals are thrown at sea. 
 Live Export Shipments are harmful to the environment. Not only are they a major factor in the pollution of air, water and land resources and bio-diversity damage, they also harm the marine ecosystem due to the huge amounts of feces and animal corpses thrown into the sea. Some of the corpses drift to beaches (including Israel's shores). 
 In addition, Live Export Shipments encourage the consumption of meat, a source of many health issues.

33,5754386.0,https://www.change.org/p/ban-all-animal-testing-in-canada,Ban animal testing in Canada,Dean Neniska,"We must work toward phasing out the use of any and all animals for any testing for any purpose. Although it would seem easier to use animals, we are realizing it is cruel and we have no right to do so. Alternatives must be created and discovered, regardless the cost increase. 
 Our advances in medicine and animal care have come at the expense of millions of animal test subjects over hundreds of years, performed by scientists from various countries. What we thought of acceptable experimentation on animals is now being regarded as a violation of humane treatment. Animal testing gave us the knowledge we have now, but it does not need to continue this way. 
 ""Vivisection (from Latin vivus, meaning ""alive"", and sectio, meaning ""cutting"") is surgery conducted for experimental purposes on a living organism, typically animals with a central nervous system, to view living internal structure."" 
 Guidelines for animal testing have included methodology such as: 
 ""The Three Rs 
 ""The Three Rs (3Rs) are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing. These were first described by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch in 1959. 
 ""The 3Rs are: 
 ""Replacement which refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims. These methods include computer modeling. Reduction which refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals. Refinement which refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. These methods include non-invasive techniques. 
 ""The 3Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided.* These 3Rs are now implemented in many testing establishments worldwide and have been adopted by various pieces of legislation and regulations. 
 (*Invertebrates could be a possible substitution for assistance to phase-out animal usage.) 
 ""Despite the widespread acceptance of the 3Rs, many countries—including Canada, Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Germany—have reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and, in some cases, fish while reporting declines in the use of cats, dogs, primates, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Along with other countries, China has also escalated its use of GM animals,* resulting in an increase in overall animal use. 
 (*Genetically modified) 
 As we know, The Quebec national assembly has passed legislation that better protects animals and defines them as sentient beings. With this shift in thinking, Canada should further make use of the momentum by taking a larger step: no longer using animals for any testing. 
 The changes needed for this can be gradual. New policies will need to be drafted. But Canada can become a world leader in animal rights and welfare. once new practices are employed.

total boycott of Israel",Indian People in Solidarity with Palestine,"Sir, 
 The whole world is witness to aggression and injustice perpetrated by Israel on the Palestinian people. Last year in the 51 days of brutal attack against the besieged Gaza city more than 2200 Palestinians died which included more than 500 children. 11,000 people were wounded or maimed including almost 3000 children. Three-fourth of the dead were civilians. More than 500,000 people were displaced and most of these are still not rehabilitated because the Israeli Zionists have been obstructing all attempts to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals and restore supply of electricity, water and medicines.  Israeli attacks against Gaza and the Palestinian people are still continuing unabated. Palestinian villages are being demolished to make way for colonies of Israeli settlers. Despite worldwide condemnation and mass protests the Zionists with the full backing of US imperialism are going ahead with their insane campaign of genocide of a people. 
             Public opinion all over the world has turned against Israel. The BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement is putting tremendous pressure on Israeli government and companies. Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel is also gaining widespread support. Several countries have already condemned the apartheid policies of Israel and have severed all relations with it and some countries have even declared Israel a terrorist state. 
             In this scenario, it is a matter of embarrassment for all justice loving and sensitive Indian citizens that our government has become one of the biggest supporters of the Zionist murderers. India has already become the single largest buyer of Israeli armaments and Israel is now the second biggest supplier of arms to India. We feel a sense of anger and shame that Indian taxpayers' money is being used to kill children and innocent people in Palestine. 
              We demand: 
 1.      The proposed visit of the Indian Prime Minister to Israel be cancelled. 
 2.      The Indian government must sever all diplomatic, military, intelligence and trade ties with Israel. The Israeli embassy in New Delhi be closed and the Indian ambassador in Tel Aviv be recalled. 
 3.      All the state governments should also cancel all MOUs signed or proposed with Israel. 
 4.      Israel's apartheid policies and aggression must be condemned on all international fora by India and the demand of a unified secular Palestine state must be supported.

 The IMMIGRATION closes the door for people from around the world that wish to experience Israel in a different way!!! 
 Does the state of Israel really want to deport a mother from Wales with a six year old son, and a German father with his six year old daughter, whose only crime it was that they came for three weeks to volunteer on an organic farm? 
 Immigration Authority inspectors visited a farm in the North on Monday  and told the two parents that they must leave the country within a week(!), because they had received a place to sleep and that was considered equal to ""Money""! 
 Later the inspectors stated that the visitors needed a volunteer visa. It certainly seems that they were simply trying to find reasons to get these people to leave the country. We can only imagine that it was ignorance of the WWOOF cause, on part of the inspectors, that they considered these volunteers to be such a threat: 
 Dear Ministry of the Interior, WWOOF began 40 years ago in England and every year 100,000 people volunteer in over 50 countries around the world; they do it because it is a wonderful experience, an opportunity where they can learn about organic farming, get to know a local family, help small farmers that have no money to pay for employees, and, as a bonus, it is also a wonderful way to travel the world while helping others! 
 How can it be that in Israel, a country that places so much value on community, you would tell people that they are being deported for volunteering, let alone telling them this in the presence of 6-year old children, who are learning such an important lesson about volunteer work and helping others?! 
 For the last eight years, thousands of volunteers have come to Israel and every day we (WWOOF Israel) get calls from farmers that tell us how wonderful this initiative is. It has been so popular in fact, that by now there are some 80 hosts already - farms and kibbutzim, scattered right across the country from the South to the North of Israel. The WWOOF site also has 259 testimonials of volunteers, saying what an amazing experience they had in Israel. 
 Is it really the intention of the government to stop all of this wonderful work now?? 
 We respectfully request that you review this case and reverse the decision made by, perhaps well-meaning, but certainly overzealous and misguided immigration officials.

 Dear Fellow WWOOFERS: 
 Please help us spread the word as much as possible in order to help those families to stay and continue to volunteer and to keep Israel open for volunteers from around the world!! THANK YOU!

 Smaller than Dublin, Ireland, Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth. 80% of its nearly 2 million residents are refugees from other parts of Israel-Palestine who were expelled from their homes in 1948 and 1967, making it the world's largest refugee camp. 
 The eight-year siege has sealed Gaza off from the world by land, air and sea, forbidding entry of desperately needed medical supplies, reconstruction materials, and such other goods as toys, crayons, books, candles, matches, fishing rods, baby formula, chocolate, pasta, coffee, shampoo, sheets, donkeys and cows. 90% of the water is undrinkable and water is expected to run out entirely by 2020 ( B'Tselem 2014 ,  UNCT oPT 2012 ,   PWA fact sheet, Mar. 2014  ) 
 This siege, which Israel does not formally acknowledge, is illegal. [1] It devastates the Gazan economy, impedes reconstruction from past bombings, separates families, prevents students from studying abroad, and hurts fishermen and farmers, who cannot pursue their livelihoods near the Buffer Zone without risk of being shot. [2] ( FAO fact sheet, 25 May 2010  ) It denies the people of Gaza legal right to live in peace, freedom and dignity, to resist military occupation, and to flee when attacked, as many of them once did to arrive in Gaza. 
 For these and many other reasons, we call on the President of the UN Security Council to pass a resolution urging all members to impose economic and political sanctions on Israel until it lifts the siege and gives the people of Gaza the chance to live a normal life. ___________________ [1] It violates Article 33 of the 4th Geneva Convention against collective punishment against a civilian population (See also A/HRC/12/37, para. 30).

 For more information concerning this petition please visit:  http://www.occupyforanimals.org/ban-religious-slaughter-throughout-europe.html   
 Occupy for Animals has requested the European Parliament to register this petition and is awaiting confirmation. By signing this petition, we will be able to notify you as soon as we have received confirmation from the European Parliament.  
 ABOUT THIS PETITION: 
 The ritual slaughter of animals decreed by Jewish and Muslim dietary laws require that the animals are conscious when they have their throats slit. In the European secular food industry, regulations strive to minimise ""the risk of causing pain, fear or distress to the animals"" in their being slaughtered for food. Crucially, these rules require the stunning of animals before being killed, either with a bolt to the brain, or with electricity. However, the law kowtows before the Jewish kashrut and Islamic halal guidelines in permitting avoidance of stunning. 
 In 2009, New Zealand veterinarian scientist Craig Johnson was given an award from the Humane Slaughter Association, for his body of work that demonstrates that animals suffer more without stunning. In one crucial experiment, Johnson et al administered mild anaesthetics to calves so that they could not feel the pain of the incision, but the pain response was still measurable. It remained present in the animals without stunning, but was immediately erased by stunning. ""I think our work is the best evidence yet that it's painful"", Johnson told New Scientist. While this may appear to come from the oft-referenced University of the Bleeding Obvious, in fact defenders of Jewish shechita and Muslim dhabiha slaughter cite scientific evidence that the practice is not painful to the animal. In 2003, the Muslim Council of Great Britainclaimed that ""the brain is instantaneously starved of blood and there is no time to start feeling any pain."" Johnson's work says otherwise. [A. Rutherford 2009] Since then at least two studies have been published in Europe (Lambooij 2008 and DIALREL 2011).  In the DIALREL report of last year, nine researchers (among them Lambooij) concluded that throat cutting without anaesthetic carried the highest risks of animals suffering: 'Pain, suffering and distress during the cut and during bleeding are highly likely.' Sedation methods are admittedly not without risks for animal wellbeing, but they are considerable smaller, claim the researchers. They cite from about 300 scientific articles and base their views on observations by veterinary researchers in slaughterhouses in Germany, Spain, England, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Israel and Australia. The European Union directive, ""European Convention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter"", generally requires stunning before slaughter, but allows member states to allow exemptions for religious slaughter: ""Each Contracting Party may authorize derogations from the provisions concerning prior stunning in the following cases: – slaughtering in accordance with religious rituals ..."". In May 2009 the European Parliament voted in favour of allowing ritual slaughter in member states. What is the difference for the animals? Non-stunned animals are slaughtered in vivid mindfulness, they experience unacceptable suffering. Their agony can last several minutes. In the context of slaughter with stunning, the animal does not suffer at the time of slaughter, since there is loss of consciousness. Scientists have clearly stated: ""Because of the serious animal welfare associated with slaughter without stunning, stunning should always be carried out before the slaughter."" In some countries, ritually killed animals are stunned before bleeding (Norway, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, New Zealand). The steps are then the same as for conventional slaughter.   The video (graphic!) in the following link demonstrates the difference between slaughter with prior stunning, vs slaughter without stunning (ritual or religious slaughter). While the animal in the first method is rendered unconscious immediately, the animals slaughtered without prior stunning experience their agony in full consciousness. You don't need to be an expert to see that this causes immense unnecessary suffering to the animals. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvH8rz7QwZM&feature=player_embedded   If we, as the dominant species on Earth (!), are to use and consume animals, it is our duty to minimize their suffering in doing so. The anachronism of slaughter without stunning has no place in the modern world and should be outlawed. This special indulgence to religious practices should be replaced with the evidence-based approaches to which the rest of us are subject.  For us, religious freedom stops where human or animal suffering begins. Our petition requests that the European Parliament prompts the Council to delete from Council Regulation (EC) No. 1099/2009 of 24 September 2009 on the Protection of Animals at the Time of Killing the derogation whereby animals can be killed without prior stunning where such methods of slaughter are prescribed by religious rites (Art. 4.4).

 At present on the Mount, non-Muslims are discriminated against  and are not even allowed to move their lips in silent prayer, contrary to numerous Supreme Court rulings. They are  routinely harassed and abused —forbidden from bringing a Bible or prayer book, and even their access is severely restricted. 
 At the Western Wall, which is under Jewish sovereignty, people from all over the world are welcome to respectfully pray. 
 The State of Israel has an obligation  to uphold Jewish sovereignty and international human rights on the Temple Mount, which include freedom of worship (according to the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  Article 18). 
 More than  1,000 experts from thirty countries  around the world have acknowledged that East Jerusalem is  not an occupied territory  under international law, and the State of Israel has officially declared its sovereignty over all of Jerusalem. 
 Jewish sovereignty over the Temple Mount is in the best interest of the human, civil, and religious rights of all people groups in Israel, including the Arab minorities. 
 We are the voice  from the international community that supports the Jewish people’s rights to sovereignty over Mt Zion—the Temple Mount. 
 We appeal to the ruling bodies of Israel to exercise their full, legal sovereignty, guaranteeing Jewish rights on their most holy place.

I am an undercover investigator for Mercy for Animals, but am not comfortable revealing my identity because this is a very hostile political climate for whistleblowers. 
 A breaking Mercy For Animals investigation using my undercover footage reveals the intentional torture of ducks for foie gras sold on Amazon. 
 French for “fatty liver,” foie gras is produced by shoving metal pipes down the throats of ducks and force-feeding them three times a day for nearly three weeks. This painful process causes the birds’ livers to swell up to ten times the normal size. These diseased, fatty livers are marketed as foie gras. 
 Wired with a hidden camera, I worked at Hudson Valley Foie Gras in New York and documented: 
 • Workers violently grabbing ducks by their wings and necks and then shoving a metal pipe down their throats to force-feed them 
 • Countless ducks hyperventilating as their unnaturally large livers pressed against their lungs making it difficult for them to breathe 
 • Dead ducks—killed by the cruel force-feeding process—callously thrown away into garbage bins 
 • Workers carelessly grabbing and tossing ducks by their fragile wings into transport cages 
 • Birds with open, bleeding wounds left to suffer in tiny wire cages without proper veterinary care 
 • Fully conscious ducks being shackled upside down and having their throats cut open, causing them to slowly bleed to death 
 Amazon has the power and the moral responsibility to help end one of the cruelest forms of factory farm animal abuse! 
 Please join MFA in calling on Amazon to take a stand against this egregious cruelty to animals by prohibiting the sale of foie gras on its website.  In the past, Amazon has ended the sale of other products like dolphin and whale meat due to their cruel production practices. 
 It’s time for Amazon to implement an ethical and humane policy banning the sale of foie gras too. 
 Target, Costco, Safeway, Giant Eagle, and Wolfgang Puck already have these policies in place. And foie gras prodcuction is banned in California, as well as Germany, Israel, the UK, and many other countries because it's so inhumane.

 This new evidence is further proof that Mahmoud is being held on trumped up charges because of his non-violent resistance to Israel's illegal occupation of the West Bank. 
 In addition, Mahmoud has been transferred to Remon prison in southern Israel. The transfer of prisoners from an occupied territory into the territory of the occupier is illegal under the Geneva Convention.

The cultural boycott is part of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions), which is the Palestinian response to the international community's failure to act on Israel's violations of international law. BDS has become a global, multi-ethnic, multi-religion, grass roots network dedicated to this nonviolent struggle to end the Israeli oppression, apartheid, siege and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians.

 I am writing to you to express my support for Professor Andrew Pessin.  
 Prof. Pessin is being demonized by students with a very specific and incendiary agenda, the destruction of any person who defends the State of Israel. These students intentionally presented Prof. Pessin’s Facebook post from August 2014 during the Hamas-Israel war, in which he defended the Israeli defensive blockade on Hamas, out of context, to both local and global audiences. They then constructed lie upon lie to misrepresent it as a racist post against Palestinians, in an attempt to intimidate him, silence him, attack his character, and destroy his career. Their actions generated a wave of hate mail and threats directed toward him and his family. 
 Connecticut College’s Administration has succumbed to this intimidation and completely failed to take action to protect Prof. Pessin from these malicious attacks which violate the appropriate norms of free speech. 
 We must look at the facts of this situation: 
 1.         Prof. Pessin’s comments on the matter do not have any hateful intent or content, but are simply the thoughts of an intellectual. Academia should be the place where students and faculty have a safe environment to discuss matters that are politically problematic. When students are allowed to bully, harass, and attack the character of a faculty member for expressing ideas that differ from their own, the entire system is destroyed.  
 2.         Lamiya Khandaker, the student who spearheaded this attack, is a self-identified advocate for the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). SJP is an organization that is openly anti-Israel, has created human walls to stop Jewish students from entering buildings where Hillel groups have meetings (Loyola University-Chicago, September 16, 2014), has applauded anti-Semitic symbols and statements, and has actually threatened university members including faculty and students. In 2014, students from this group were suspended from Northeastern University for posing with an AR-15 assault weapon and wearing the headband of the Islamic Jihad. In addition, SJP members have vandalized Jewish fraternities, and defaced statues of Jewish donors and trustees. 
 3.         The Anti-Defamation League considers Khandaker’s organization one which continues to support violence and acts of anti-Semitism.  Yet Connecticut College has sided with such an organization over a beloved tenured faculty member with an impeccable 10-year record of serving his students and his institution with honor and integrity.  It’s hard not to see this as an act of anti-Semitism focused on the only Jewish professor on its campus who openly advocates for Israel. 
 4.         To identify the actions of these students as furthering free speech is an absolute untruth. Free speech, formerly a given on college campuses across this country, means having safe and civil dialogues where all parties are heard without concern for threats or intimidation. These students are hiding their political motives and bullying tactics under the pretense of their own free speech while violently oppressing Prof. Pessin’s right to free speech via their incendiary accusations of racism.  For Connecticut College to allow this violates and insults the most basic liberal values that most of us hold dear. 
 5.         Finally, we must address the claim that Ms. Khandaker feels “unsafe” due to Prof. Pessin’s supposed racism and, in an exaggerated distortion, states that “academics are publicizing” this hate. This is the biggest hypocrisy and double standard. Prof. Pessin supports a two-state solution in the Middle East and his Facebook entries throughout the 2014 Hamas-Israel war compassionately express his outrage over the civilian deaths on both sides. On her own Facebook page (quickly deleted after her campaign began), Lamiya Khandaker openly scoffed at anti-Semitism in the world and called for the destruction of Israel via a one-state solution. She trolled Prof. Pessin’s Facebook entries to find a post that could be distorted in order to bully, discredit, and defame him. She has created a culture of hate where no professor or student would ever feel safe to express views on any controversial topic at Connecticut College again.  Israeli news outlets have actually identified her actions as the new “Brownshirt style bullies,” in reference to the actions of anti-Semites that destroyed the important Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism created by Dr. Charles Small. 
 In the early stages of the creation of American colleges and universities, founders identified the fact that these were places of free thought, free speech and open dialogue. To cower in the face of a student determined to create fear of speaking freely is to destroy the original intent of education. To destroy a man’s career at a student’s whim simply because he is an open supporter of Israel is to kowtow to the student’s intent to wipe him from the campus landscape and to further hate, not stop it. 
 We, sincere proponents of genuine free speech, will no longer stand in the face of such anti-Semitic and anti-liberal acts of oppression. We will support anyone who believes that Academia should remain a place of free and open dialogue (whatever religion) and we will decry violence and harassment by those determined to annihilate genuine freedom of expression. 
 This is not about Israel. This is not about Palestine. This is not about Hamas. This is about freedom to work in a safe place where you do not fear that you will be attacked by those whom you serve. 
  Thank you for your support.

52,1482446.0,https://www.change.org/p/alexis-tsipras-ban-fur-farming-in-greece,Alexis Tsipras: Ban Fur Farming in Greece.,FurAbolition,"In recent years in Greece, there is an increase in fur farms in the region of West Macedonia. West Macedonia is divided into the regional units of Florina, Grevena, Kastoria, and Kozani. In 2011 there were 43 fur farms in Greece. According to the figures from the Ministry of Rural Development and Food  (March 2014), fur farms have increased to 105! 
 Kastoria – 45 fur farms 
 Kozani – 50 fur farms 
 Grevena – 8 fur farms 
 Florina – 2 fur farms 
 More than 2.500.000 minks are killed in Greece every year. New fur farms are under construction. Please help us stop the rapidly expanding fur farming in Greece. 
 Mink, the main specie of animals reared in fur factory farms in Greece, is still essentially wild animal. They are unsuitable to be kept for production purposes. These animals spend short and miserable lives in small wire cages, only to be gassed to death when their pelts are at their prime.  
 The conditions under which fur farmed animals are kept do not satisfy their behavioural needs. Their caged environment is monotonous and physical exercise is restricted. The animals are also unable to express their species-specific behaviours. Foxes, for example, are denied the opportunity to dig, while mink have no access to swimming water and cannot avoid social contact. 
 As a consequence, animals on fur farms have routinely been found to exhibit stereotyped behaviour (such as pacing along the cage wall, repetitive circling/nodding of the head, etc.), as well as self-mutilation (i.e. sucking or biting of the animal’s tail fur, or other parts of the pelts). Infanticide and cannibalism has also been reported. 
 Fur farming is already banned outright in Austria and the United Kingdom. It was also banned in Croatia from 2007 with a 10 year phase-out period for existing farms. In December 2012, the Netherlands, which is the EU’s second largest mink producer, passed a ban on fur farming and will phase-out mink production entirely by 2024. Slovenia also banned fur farming in March 2013 with a three year phase-out for existing producers. Proposed legislation to prohibit fur farming is also currently being considered in Belgium, Estonia and Israel. Italian region Emilia Romagna also moves towards ban on fur farming.  
 The fur industry is keen to promote itself as a ‘green’ and sustainable industry. Fur is often presented as a ‘natural’ product, but in reality it requires a lot of processing, transporting and inputs before it can be made ready to wear. 
 The claim that fur is a ‘green’ product has also been strongly contradicted by the findings of a recent study into the environmental impact of mink production. The claim that fur is a ‘green’ product has also been strongly contradicted by the findings of a recent study into the environmental impact of mink production. 
 http://eurogroupforanimals.org/files/news/downloads/570/ffa__eurogroup_briefing_for_meps_on_the_fur_industry_english_version.pdf 
 We call on to the Greek Government to stop any investment on new fur farms and to ban fur farming in Greece.

 Τα τελευταία χρόνια παρατηρείται στη χώρα μας μία αύξηση των εκτροφείων γουνοφόρων ζώων στην περιοχή της Δυτικής Μακεδονίας, και συγκεκριμένα στους νομούς Καστοριάς, Κοζάνης, Γρεβενών και Φλώρινας ενώ υπάρχουν σχέδια για δημιουργία εκτροφείων και στην Περιφέρεια της Κεντρικής Μακεδονίας. 
 Η ανάπτυξη αυτή οφείλεται στην κυβερνητική πολιτική  των τελευταίων ετών υπέρ του κλάδου της γούνας με επιδοτήσεις και ευνοϊκές ειδικές νομοθετικές ρυθμίσεις, όπως η ένταξη των εκτροφείων γουνοφόρων ζώων στις κτηνοτροφικές εγκαταστάσεις (Ν.4056/12), η δυνατότητα ένταξης της εκτροφής γουνοφόρων σε επενδυτικά σχέδια με κοινοτική ή εθνική ενίσχυση, η απλοποίηση της αδειοδότησης νέων εγκαταστάσεων, η παράταση της προσωρινής άδειας εγκατάστασης εκτροφής γουνοφόρων ζώων, η κατάργηση του φόρου πολυτελείας για τα γουνοποιητικά προϊόντα στο πολυνομοσχέδιο που ψηφίστηκε πρόσφατα ,  κ.λπ. Η προνομιακή αυτή πολιτική έδωσε κίνητρα και αύξησε το ενδιαφέρον των επενδυτών με αποτέλεσμα τα τελευταία χρόνια να ανοίγουν συνεχώς νέα εκτροφεία στην περιοχή της Δυτικής Μακεδονίας. Επίσης συμπίπτει με την γενικότερη στάση Ευρωπαϊκών χωρών που είτε απαγόρευσαν είτε βρίσκονται σε πορεία απαγόρευσης της εκτροφής. Η συγκυρία αυτή σε συνδυασμό με την αντίδραση Ευρωπαίων πολιτών δημιουργεί ένα επενδυτικό ενδιαφέρον από ξένους εκτροφείς για νέες μονάδες στην Ελλάδα και οδηγεί τους εκτροφείς - με τις ευλογίες της πολιτείας -  στη χώρα μας. 
 Εκτροφή και θανάτωση γουνοφόρων ζώων 
 Το εμπόριο γούνας καταδικάζεται παγκοσμίως λόγω της βαρβαρότητας προς τα ζώα. Η εκτροφή και η θανάτωση ζώων για τη γούνα τους είναι μια εξαιρετικά βάναυση πρακτική που πρέπει άμεσα να καταργηθεί και όχι να χρηματοδοτείται και να αναπτύσσεται. Κάθε χρόνο στην Ελλάδα εκατοντάδες χιλιάδες μινκ εκτρέφονται και θανατώνονται με αποκλειστικό σκοπό την παραγωγή γούνας. Αυτά τα ζώα περνούν μία πολύ σύντομη και εντελώς αφύσικη ζωή, φυλακισμένα μέσα σε μικρά μεταλλικά κλουβιά, μόνο και μόνο για να θανατωνούν όταν η γούνα τους είναι στη κατάλληλη κατάσταση. Τα μινκ, επί της ουσίας παραμένουν άγρια ζώα, τα οποία δεν προσαρμόζονται στο περιβάλλον αιχμαλωσίας των εκτροφείων και τα διάφορα προβλήματα ευημερίας τους, παραμένουν άλυτα αφού είναι ευρέως αποδεκτό ότι «τα μινκ και οι αλεπούδες υποφέρουν από τον εγκλεισμό σε κλωβούς διότι περιορίζεται η συμπεριφορά τους ως άγρια ζώα». Αυτό αποδεικνύεται και από το γεγονός ότι τα ζώα επιστρέφουν πολύ γρήγορα στη φυσική τους συμπεριφορά όταν διαφύγουν από τα εκτροφεία. 
 Οι συνθήκες που τα ζώα αυτά εξαναγκάζονται να υπομένουν είναι βασανιστικές, με αποτέλεσμα συχνά να τρελαίνονται από τον εγκλεισμό, να οδηγούνται στον κανιβαλισμό ή ακόμα και να τρώνε τα ίδια τους τα άκρα. Πολλά ζώα υποφέρουν από μολύνσεις στα μάτια, τραύματα στα άκρα, ανοιχτές πληγές, κομμένες ουρές, παραμορφωμένα άκρα και αυτιά, ασθένειες του στόματος, πρησμένα ούλα και πολλά άλλα ( 1 ). 
 Τα ζώα στα εκτροφεία γούνας συστηματικά παρουσιάζουν στερεοτυπική συμπεριφορά (όπως ο βηματισμός κατά μήκος της μιας πλευράς του κλουβιού τους, οι συνεχείς κυκλικές κινήσεις, το κυκλικό κούνημα του κεφαλιού, κ.λπ.) και φαινόμενα αυτοακρωτηριασμού. Έχουν επίσης αναφερθεί περιπτώσεις βρεφοκτονίας και κανιβαλισμού. Παρόλο που η βιομηχανία γούνας υποστηρίζει ότι τέτοιες αφύσικες συμπεριφορές έχουν περιοριστεί μέσω (υποτυπώδους) εμπλουτισμού των κλουβιών, υλικό από πρόσφατες έρευνες δείχνει ότι τέτοιες αφύσικες συμπεριφορές και περιστατικά αυτοτραυματισμών, συνεχίζουν να υφίστανται στα εκτροφεία γούνας της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης.

 Επιπρόσθετα στην ταυτοποίηση αφύσικων συμπεριφορών, πρόσφατες έρευνες σε εκτροφεία γούνας αποκάλυψαν μια σειρά σημαντικών προβλημάτων υγείας και ευζωίας στα εκτροφεία που ερευνήθηκαν: 
 Απεριποίητες, σοβαρές μολύνσεις στα μάτια, στη μύτη και στα αυτιά των ζώων 
 Ανωμαλίες στα ούλα και στην περιοχή γύρω από τα δόντια,  έντονα ερεθισμένα ούλα 
 Ανοιχτές πληγές, κοψίματα και τραυματισμοί 
 Απώλεια ουρών ή / και άκρων 
 Παραμορφωμένα άκρα 
 Κανιβαλισμός νεκρών αδερφών ή απογόνων 
 Σαπισμένα πτώματα που έχουν αφεθεί μέσα σε κλουβιά με ζωντανά ζώα 
 Κουτσά ζώα 
 Διαλυμένα κλουβιά με αιχμηρά σύρματα και πλέγματα που βρίσκονται εντός του περιβάλλοντος που ζουν τα ζώα 
 Άδειες, βρόμικες ή / και διαλυμένες ποτίστρες 
 Η θανάτωση των ζώων στα εκτροφεία γούνας συμβαίνει όταν η γούνα τους είναι στην καλύτερη δυνατή κατάσταση και κάθε ελάττωμα έχει εξαφανιστεί. Στις επιτρεπόμενες μεθόδους θανάτωσης συμπεριλαμβάνονται: 
 Πλήγμα στο κρανίο με κρούση 
 Διοξείδιο του άνθρακα σε υψηλή συγκέντρωση 
 Μονοξείδιο του άνθρακα καθαρό 
 Μονοξείδιο του άνθρακα με άλλα αέρια 
 Ηλεκτροπληξία (χρησιμοποιώντας ηλεκτρόδια που τοποθετούνται στο ζώο στο στόμα και τον πρωκτό) 
 Τα μινκ, που κατά βάση θανατώνονται με αέρια, είναι ημιυδρόβια ζώα και έχουν φυσιολογία ανεπτυγμένη κατά τέτοιο τρόπο που τους επιτρέπει να κρατούν την αναπνοή τους. Τα μινκ έχουν την ικανότητα να αντιλαμβάνονται την έλλειψη οξυγόνου στο αίμα τους και είναι επιρρεπή στην υποξία, γεγονός που σημαίνει ότι υποφέρουν σημαντικά κατά τη διαδικασία θανάτωσης με αέρια (Raj, M., Mason, G. (1999). Reaction of farmed mink (Mustela vison) to argon-induced hypoxia. Veterinary Record). 
 Κτηνίατροι έχουν εκφράσει τις ανησυχίες τους για τη χρήση αυτών των αερίων λόγω διαφόρων αιτιών (μεταξύ των οποίων η μακρά περίοδος που απαιτείται μέχρι να χάσουν τις αισθήσεις τους τα ζώα και οι πρακτικές δυσκολίες στην επίτευξη αξιόπιστης υψηλής συγκέντρωσης αερίου στο χώρο θανάτωσης) και χαρακτηρίζουν τη χρήση αυτών των αερίων  επώδυνη και μη αποδεκτή μέθοδο θανάτωσης ζώων.  Η θανάτωση με ηλεκτροπληξία απαιτεί σε μεγάλο βαθμό τον περιορισμό του ζώου αλλά και τη χρήση ηλεκτροδίων τα οποία εισάγονται στο ζώο μέσα από τα ανοίγματά του και υπάρχει το ενδεχόμενο έντονου πόνου και έντονης αγωνίας για το ζώο. 
 Εν όψει της έμφυτης και αχρείαστης βαναυσότητας που περιλαμβάνεται στην εκτροφή και θανάτωση των γουνοφόρων ζώων, η απαγόρευση της εκτροφής τους είναι επιβεβλημένη. 
 Η Κίνηση Για την Κατάργηση του Εμπορίου Γούνας και η Πρωτοβουλία Πολιτών «Η Καστοριά Λέει Όχι στην Γούνα», σε κοινή τους επιστολή προς τα αρμόδια Υπουργεία και τις αρμόδιες Περιφερειακές Διευθύνσεις ζητούν την άμεση διακοπή κάθε επενδυτικού σχεδίου που αφορά ίδρυση νέου εκτροφείου ή επέκταση υφιστάμενου, την απαγόρευση της εκτροφής ζώων για τη γούνα τους, όπως έχει συμβεί σε άλλες χώρες, και την σταδιακή αλλαγή του παραγωγικού προτύπου στη Δυτική Μακεδονία. 
 Στην επιστολή επίσης αναφέρονται: 
 
 Οι επιπτώσεις τόσο από την εκτροφή όσο και από την επεξεργασία των γουνοδερμάτων στο περιβάλλον, το ενεργειακό κόστος του κλάδου της γούνας και η υποβάθμιση της ζωής των κατοίκων. 
 Οι επιπτώσεις στη βιοποικιλότητα με την αποδυνάμωση ή ακόμα και την εξαφάνιση διαφόρων ειδών, την εισαγωγή ξενικών ειδών στο περιβάλλον και τις επιπτώσεις για τις γύρω δραστηριότητες του ανθρώπου. 
 Οι αντιδράσεις κατοίκων, τοπικών παραγόντων και οργανώσεων για τη λειτουργία των εκτροφείων σε άλλες χώρες. 
 Η απαγόρευση της εκτροφής γουνοφόρων ζώων σε άλλα Ευρωπαϊκά κράτη. 
 Η απαγόρευση πώλησης γούνας σε μεγάλες αλυσίδες καταστημάτων. 
 Η εκμετάλλευση των εργαζομένων από λίγους μεγαλοεπιχειρηματίες και οι άθλιες συνθήκες εργασίας των γουνεργατών που με την πάροδο των χρόνων οδηγούν στην εμφάνιση σοβαρών προβλημάτων υγείας.  
 Οι προοπτικές βιωσιμότητας και ανάπτυξης της γούνας και η ποικιλότητα των επιρροών που δέχεται ο κλάδος και που οδήγησαν τα περασμένα έτη τη γούνα σε έντονη κρίση και η αβεβαιότητα που διακατέχει τη γουνοποιία. 
 Η κυριαρχία του κυκλώματος της γούνας που προκάλεσε την εμφάνιση του φαινομένου της μονοδιάστατης ενασχόλησης με την γουνοποιία στην περιοχή, με αποτέλεσμα την υψηλή ανεργία, το χαμηλό μορφωτικό επίπεδο, τα χαμηλά εισοδήματα, και την υποτυπώδη ανάπτυξη άλλων οικονομικών δραστηριοτήτων. 
 Οι εναλλακτικές ανάπτυξης της περιοχής και η ανάγκη για ένα νέο αναπτυξιακό πρότυπο προσανατολισμένο στην αειφορική ανάπτυξη της Περιφέρειας της Δυτικής Μακεδονίας, στην σηµαντική βελτίωση της ποιότητας ζωής των κατοίκων, στην ενίσχυση του εισοδήµατος τους,  στη βελτίωση του μορφωτικού επιπέδου των κατοίκων, στην ανάπτυξη και στη δημιουργία βιώσιμων θέσεων απασχόλησης, με έμφαση στην προστασία του περιβάλλοντος και στο σεβασμό των ζώων, δύο παραγόντων που κρίνονται πλέον σημαντικοί για τους Έλληνες πολίτες και η πολιτεία οφείλει να τους λάβει υπόψη της.

 Countless animals around the globe suffer in cruel experiments to test cosmetics – rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice and rats are routinely injected, gassed, force-fed and killed for cosmetics testing worldwide. 
 We believe this is ethically unacceptable and unnecessary.  Alternative tests are available which are more reliable, faster and cheaper than the animal tests they replace. 
 The European Union, India, Israel have all banned cruel cosmetics, proving it is possible to have a thriving cosmetics industry without cruel animal tests. 
 On the first anniversary of the EU ban, Cruelty Free International is sending a detailed proposal to the Health Minister Peter Dutton. Please add your support to Cruelty Free International’s call on the Government of Australia to implement a ban on the use of animals to test cosmetics and ingredients by December 2015.

It was heartbreaking seeing the daily harassments that the Palestinians and beduin tribes were exposed to; it afflicted women, children, old people, peasants, workers – every single person living in the territories occupied by Israel. 
 As we learned from South African apartheid, a state that makes its inhabitants victims of apartheid policies and practices, won't stop until the people of the world react. It is time we wake up once more! 
 The governments of the world, as well as do the EU and the UN, know more than enough about what is going on ""on the ground"" in the occupied territories, but still they don't put any power at all behind all their resolutions.

 I demand this from all governments, including and  especially  my own . 
 Furthermore, I encourage all UN member states to fulfill their obligations according to the resolutions they themselves have passed through both the Security Council and General Assembly condemning the policies of the State of Israel toward Palestine and the Palestinian people.

If a passenger was flouting the rules for take-off, thereby causing flight delay, they would immediately be removed from the plane. 
 If a passenger was openly engaging in racial or religious discrimination against another passenger or flight attendant, they would immediately be removed from the plane. 
 Why then, does El Al Airlines allow gender discrimination against women? 
 Why does El Al Airlines permit female passengers to be bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by El Al Airlines? One person's religious rights do not trump another person's civil rights.  
 If El Al Airlines wants to truly accommodate all of its passengers, it will reserve a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight, where for a fee, those passengers who need such seating can pre-book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take-off to change seats with them - thereby avoiding arguments, bullying, and delayed take-off. 
 If, under government regulations forbidding airline carriers to offer segregated seating based upon sex, El Al is unable to carry out such religious accomodations directly, perhaps indirectly El Al can refer such requests to independent private travel agencies who buy block seating for such purposes. Religious passengers could then purchase tickets through those private agencies that will guarantee same sex seating.   
 There are some incredibly creative and talented minds out there - Ari Teman and his firm 12Gurus created this mock-up cabin configuration - complete with the idea of changeable partitions (to block sound from noisy groups and children) that enable adjustments in the numbers of rows necessary for individual flights based on passenger seating preferences.

 Countless animals around the globe suffer in cruel experiments to test cosmetics – rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice and rats are routinely injected, gassed, force-fed and killed for cosmetics testing worldwide. 
 We believe this is ethically unacceptable and unnecessary.  Alternative tests are available which are more reliable, faster and cheaper than the animal tests they replace. 
 The European Union, India, Israel have all banned cruel cosmetics, proving it is possible to have a thriving cosmetics industry without cruel animal tests. 
 On the first anniversary of the EU ban, Cruelty Free International is sending a detailed proposal to the ASEAN Secretary General. Please add your support to Cruelty Free International’s call on ASEAN to implement a ban on the use of animals to test cosmetics and ingredients by December 2015. 
 1 million people have already added their names to Cruelty Free International’s pledge for a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics. 
 ASEAN must not get left behind – it is time to turn our backs on cruel cosmetics tests forever.","Petitioning  His Excellency Le Luong Minh, Secretary-General of ASEAN","End animal testing for cosmetics in ASEAN by December 2015 I urge you to support Cruelty Free International’s proposal to ban cruel animal tests for cosmetics and ingredients by December 2015.
